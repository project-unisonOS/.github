# UnisonOS

**UnisonOS is an edge-first, human-centered AI platform for personal computing.**

It treats intelligence as a **local capability** - running on your own hardware, shaped by your objectives, and orchestrated through natural interaction rather than apps, files, or commands. Nothing new to learn. No cloud dependency by default.

UnisonOS is designed to invert the traditional computing model:
the system adapts to the person - not the other way around.

## Why UnisonOS Exists

Modern AI systems optimize for platforms, products, and engagement.
People are left adapting to tools that do not reflect their goals,
values, accessibility needs, or privacy expectations.

UnisonOS exists to make a different model possible:

- **People control the objectives of their AI**
- **Intelligence runs locally whenever possible**
- **Agency, consent, and context are first-class system concerns**
- **Accessibility is foundational - not an add-on**

UnisonOS is a new computing substrate for intent-driven interaction.

## What UnisonOS Is

UnisonOS is built as a **collection of modular services** that work together as a coherent system. Each repository in this organization contributes to one or more core platform layers, including:

- Identity and consent
- Context modeling and baton handoff
- Secure local storage
- Inference (local and hybrid)
- Device and modality I/O (speech, vision, actuation, etc.)
- Agent orchestration and intent routing

The system is designed to run on consumer hardware and evolve toward new form factors over time.

## Start Here

If you are new to the project, begin with:

**`unison-workspace`**  
A meta-repository that explains the platform, repository layout, and recommended learning paths.

From there, most contributors explore:
- `unison-devstack` – Local development environment
- `unison-orchestrator` – Core intent and agent coordination
- Core platform services as needed for their area of work

## Getting Started

- Visit **https://unisonos.ai** for the full introduction, architecture overview, and developer documentation
- Review the **unison-workspace** repository to understand how the system fits together
- See individual repository READMEs for build instructions and workflows
