# UnisonOS

**UnisonOS is an edge-first platform for personal AI.**  
It treats intelligence as a local capability—running on your hardware, shaped by your objectives, and orchestrated through a natural interaction model that requires nothing to learn.

UnisonOS is built as a collection of modular services that work together as a coherent system. Each repository in this organization contributes to the platform’s core layers, including identity, consent, context, storage, inference, device I/O, and agent orchestration.

## Why UnisonOS Exists

People should control the objectives of their AI.  
Technology should conform to the person—not the other way around.  
UnisonOS is a new computing substrate designed to make that shift possible.

## Developer Entry Point
